# Particles Cursor

A fun and interactive **particles cursor** effect that creates colorful particles on mouse movement. This project uses HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript to generate dynamic particles that follow your mouse, giving your website a visually stunning, energetic look!

## Features
- **Interactive Particles:** Creates multiple particles on every mouse move.
- **Random Colors:** Each particle has a random color, giving a vibrant and dynamic effect.
- **Smooth Animation:** Particles gradually shrink over time, creating a smooth fade-out effect.
- **Responsive:** Automatically adjusts to different screen sizes with the canvas resizing on window resize.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5** for structure
- **CSS** for styling
- **JavaScript** for interactive particle generation and animation
- **Canvas API** for drawing and animating particles

## How It Works
1. **Canvas Setup:** The canvas fills the entire screen and is positioned absolutely to cover the entire viewport.
2. **Particle Creation:** Every time the user moves the mouse, multiple particles are created at the mouse's position.
3. **Particle Behavior:** Each particle moves in random directions, shrinks over time, and fades away.
4. **Particle Colors:** Random colors are applied to each particle to give a vibrant, energetic look.
